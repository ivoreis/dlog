# SSG - Static Site Generation

import { NextPage } from 'next'

const Profile: NextPage<{slug: string}> = (props) => {

  // or fail if path cannot be found
  return { paths, fallback: false }
}

export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const res = await fetch('') // use params.slug to fetch the data
  const post = await res.json()

<div className="px-8">
  This example demonstrate the use of two new methods: __getStaticPaths__ and __getStaticProps__. 

  __getStaticPaths__ is used to create a list of all possible routes (paths) that will be generated. 
  Then __getStaticProps__ is used to resolve or fetch the properties that are needed by the render method.

# SSG - Use cases

You should use SSG if you have a finite number of pages that need to pre generated. When you build the NextJS application, 
all these pages will be generated and once the build process is complete, all the generated pages will be available straight away
to any requests. 

You can still use __CSR__ methods to fetch new data on the client and keep all the data fresh.

In case you need to have the best of both worlds (__SSR + SSG__), ie, pages generated at build time and still being able to regenerate once the underlined 
resources change, you'll be better off enabling __ISG__ (Incremental Static Regeneration).
