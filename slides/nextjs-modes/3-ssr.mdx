  By including a new method called __getServerSideProps__ you'll be enabling the __SSR mode__ in NextJS. 

  Doing this, it allows you to use server utilities like fetching directly from a database or invoking local API implementations.

# SSR - Use cases


You should use __getServerSideProps__ only if you need to pre-render a 
page whose data must be fetched at request time. 

__Time to first byte (TTFB)__ will be slower than __getStaticProps__ because the server must 
compute the result on every request, and the result __cannot be cached by a 
CDN without extra configuration__.

If you donâ€™t need to pre-render the data, then you should consider fetching data on the client side.
