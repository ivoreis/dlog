# Capital Markets

Capital markets are composed of __primary__ and __secondary markets__. 
The most common capital markets are the stock market and the bond market.

These markets are divided into two different categories:
- __Primary Markets__, where new equity stock and bond issues are sold to investors 
and;
- __Secondary Markets__, which trade existing securities. 


Primary markets are facilitated by __underwriting groups__ consisting of investment banks 
that set a beginning price range for a given security and oversee its sale to investors. 

This process is called __security underwriting__ and 
investment banks are involved in both __equity__ and __debt issuing__.

## SEO (Seasoned Equity Offering AKA Follow On Offering)

A SEO refers to any issuance of new shares that follows a company's IPO process.
The issuance is an already publicly traded company that is coming back to the market to raise more capital.

There are two types of SEOs: __diluted__ and __non-diluted__ offerings. 
A __diluted follow-on offering__ results in the company issuing new shares after the IPO, 
which causes the lowering of a company's earnings per share (EPS).

During a __non-diluted follow-on offering__, shares coming into the market 
__are already existing__ and the EPS remains unchanged.

The main role of an investment bank will be to __create a list of potential buyers__ and __underwrite 
the stock__ once sufficient demand has been established.

## Private Placements

Private placement is a common method of __raising business capital__ by offering equity shares. 
Private placements can be done by either __private companies__ wishing to acquire a few select 
investors or by __publicly traded companies__ as a __secondary stock offering__.

A private placement __has minimal regulatory requirements__ that it must abide by. 
The investment __does not require a prospectus__ and, quite often, detailed financial information is not disclosed.

# Capital Markets - Issuing Debt

One way for a business to raise capital is by __selling a portion of the business or 
equity__ but there is other way, __issuing debt or borrowing capital__.

Investment Companies help by __advising loan terms__, __preparing company presentations__, __finding investors__ and __issuing debt__.

Debt issuance comes in a form of bonds with maturity of 5, 10 or 20 years and can be:
- __Fixed Rate Bonds__
  - Fixed interest rate (correlated to company's __Credit Rating__)
- __Floating Rate Bonds__
  - Linked to a reference rate (__Ex__: Federal interest rate + 3%)
- __Equity Related Bonds__
  - Debt securities paying an interest rate that can be converted into equity
- __Asset Backed Securities__
  - Bonds issued by a __Special Purpose Vehicle__ (SPV) (Ex: Mortgage loans, credit cards receivables, auto loans and others)
