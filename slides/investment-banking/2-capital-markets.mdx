# Capital Markets

Capital markets are composed of __primary__ and __secondary markets__. 
The __most common capital markets__ are the __stock market__ and the __bond market__.

These markets are divided into two different categories:
- __Primary Markets__, where new equity stock and bond issues are sold to investors 
and;
- __Secondary Markets__, which trade existing securities. 


Primary markets are facilitated by __underwriting groups__ consisting of investment banks 
that set a beginning price range for a given security and oversee its sale to investors. 

This process is called __security underwriting__ and 
investment banks are involved in both __equity__ and __debt issuing__.

# Capital Markets - Issuing Equity

## __IPO (Initial Public Offering)__ 

One way Investment banks help companies raise capital is via equity issuance in a shape of an IPO.
This is a long process that required a lot of scrutiny and that's where Investment banks provide most needed help.

This is a process that must be carried out at the right moment, 
when the company has the __right size__, __profitability levels__, __solid administration, management team and growth__ and 
it can take between __4-6 months__ to be complete. Some of the steps/phases might include:

- Hiring advisors (Legal, Industry, Tax and Financials experts)
- Company Valuation
- Drafting the Prospectus
- Book Building
- Road Show
- Marketing
- Shares Allocations
- Listing

## SEO (Seasoned Equity Offering AKA Follow On Offering)

A SEO refers to any issuance of new shares that follows a company's IPO process.
The issuance is an already publicly traded company that is coming back to the market to raise more capital.

There are two types of SEOs: __diluted__ and __non-diluted__ offerings. 
A __diluted follow-on offering__ results in the company issuing new shares after the IPO, 
which causes the lowering of a company's __earnings per share__ (EPS).

During a __non-diluted follow-on offering__, shares coming into the market 
__are already existing__ and the __EPS__ remains unchanged.

The main role of an investment bank is to __create a list of potential buyers__ and __underwrite 
the stock__ once sufficient demand has been established.

Private placement are also a common method of __raising business capital__ by offering equity shares. 

Private placements can be done by either __private companies__ wishing to acquire a few select 
investors or by __publicly traded companies__ as a __secondary stock offering__.

A private placement __has minimal regulatory requirements__ that it must abide by. 
The investment __does not require a prospectus__ and, quite often, detailed financial information is not disclosed or required.

# Capital Markets - Issuing Debt

One way for a business to raise capital is by __selling a portion of the business or 
equity__ but there's another way, __borrowing capital or issuing debt__.

Investment banks help companies by __advising loan terms__, __preparing company presentations__, __finding investors__ and __issuing debt__.

Debt issuance comes in a form of bonds with maturity of 5, 10, 20+ years and can be:
- __Fixed Rate Bonds__
  - Fixed interest rate (correlated to company's __Credit Rating__)
- __Floating Rate Bonds__
  - Linked to a reference rate (__Ex__: Federal interest rate + 3%)
- __Equity Related Bonds__
  - Debt securities paying an interest rate that can be converted into equity
- __Asset Backed Securities__
  - Bonds issued by a __Special Purpose Vehicle__ (SPV) (Ex: Mortgage loans, credit cards receivables, auto loans and others)
