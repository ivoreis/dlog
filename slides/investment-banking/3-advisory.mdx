Companies also acquire important __intellectual property__ (IP), __key personal__ and 
__industry know-how__ via M&A. 

## How do investment banks help?

companies in the same industry and that gives them an __unique perspective of the market__.

## M&A Lifecycle

Company stage lifecycle:
	- Development (early days, start-up)
	- Growth (Scale-up)
	- Maturity (very profitable)
	- Decline (loses market share)

M&A
	- Development  (bolt-on acquisitions)
		- Rarely acquire other companies
		- acquired for their innovative ideas and quality team
	- Growth (Acquisitions)
		- Very attractive for potential acquires
		- Defensive M&A of smaller firms
	- Maturity (Mergers, LBO)
		- Frequent buyer of Startups, Scaleups
		- Mergers of equals (Merger of competitors)
	- Decline (Takeover, Restructuring)
		- Acquired for name, IP, know-how or brands 

Types of M&A transactions
	- Private transactions (1 or 2 bidders)
		- Easy to organise
		- No sense of urgency for the buyer
		- Often avoided by sell-side bankers
	- Auction (bidding contest)
		- Involves tens of interested bidders (aim to get 5/6 bidders)
		- The perception of competition increases the price
	- Acquisition of listed companies
		- Complicated due to regulatory requirements
		- Friendly or hostile takeover
		- Much easier valuation
Buyers often offer a premium on top of share price

Financial vs Corporate Buyers
	- Corporate Buyers are firms operating in the same industry as the Target

		- Integration of management of the two companies
	- Financial Buyers 
		- Focus on cash flows and capital gains
		- 3/5 year investment horizon
		- Do not operate in the target's industry
		- Looking for:
			- Venture Capital Funds -> Startup
			- Private Equity Funds -> Growth Companies
Leveraged Buyout funds -> Mature Companies
