# Advisory

__Advisory__ is one of the __oldest services__ provided by investment banks and can be structured as __Assistance in M&A transactions__ and __Debt Restructuring__.


## Why is M&A important?

Sometimes it is cheaper to acquire a company than generating the business internally. 
It's common to say that in M&A <Emphasis>1 + 1 > 2</Emphasis> because companies 
end up __leveraging savings__, __efficiencies__ and __opportunities__ (Synergies).
Companies also acquire important __intellectual property__ (IP), __key personal__ and 
__industry know-how__ via M&A. 

## How do investment banks help?

Investment banks have __deep industry knowledge__, because they tend to advise multiple 
companies in the same industry and that gives them an __unique perspective of the market__. 
This same perspective and their long contact list puts them in a very good place to 
__find potential bidders and targets__.

# Advisory - M&A transactions

Investment Banks can advise two sides of a transaction, the __buy-side__ (buyer) or the __sell-side__ (target/vendor).
Banks usually prefer to be on the __sell-side__ given the likeliness to transact is higher and therefore, __guaranteed fees__.
On the other hand, banks that advise the __buy-side__ receive a __retainer fee__ and __an extra fee__ on deal completion.

### Sell-side key responsibilities

	- Find a large number of bidders
	- Prepare the company for all questions asked by buyers
	- Make valuation of the business (__DCF, Multiples, LBO__) and suggest minimum bidding price
	- Coordinate the sales process

### Buy-side key responsibilities
	- Strategic advice
	- Provide valuation of target
