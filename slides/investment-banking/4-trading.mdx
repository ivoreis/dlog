# Trading

__Trading__ is one of the main revenue channels for investment banks, 
and usually generate between 35%-50% of the total global revenues.

Trading  can be divided into 2 distinct types: __Proprietary trading__ (Trading) 
or __Brokerage__.

In __brokerage__, the investment bank __trade on behalf of the clients__ and __profit from
a bid/ask spread__ and tend to have a __long term investment strategy__.

__Proprietary trading__, on the other hand, the bank uses its __own money to buy
securities__ and __sell them at a profit__ and tend to have a __short-term investment strategy horizon__.

There are multiple types of instruments that investment bank trade, such as:
__Shares, Bonds, and Derivatives__. 

Derivatives are a very interesting topic and investors mostly use them
to __reduce investment risk__ (__hedging__) or for __speculative__ reasons. Some derivatives examples
are: __Forwards__, __Futures__, __Options__ and __Swaps__.
